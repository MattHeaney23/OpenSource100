# OpenSource100

**Progress:** 3 / 100 ✅  

This is a build-in-public challenge where I contribute to 100 open source Swift projects.

Each contribution must involve a new feature, a critical fix, or work in an unfamiliar area. Small changes like typo fixes don’t count.

This challenge is designed to grow my ability to jump into any Swift project and deliver meaningful, immediate value.

## ✅ 1. Deep Dish Swift (Unofficial)  
**Project:** [MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie](https://github.com/MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie)  
**My PR:** [#19](https://github.com/MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie/pull/19)

I added an App Clip to the unofficial Deep Dish Swift app, ahead of giving a talk on App Clips at Deep Dish Swift 2025. This included creating the App Clip target, restructuring the code for modular use, and collaborating with the maintainer to support associated domains, submit to Apple, and release the App Clip.

## ✅ 2. Scrumdinger  
**Project:** [JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger](https://github.com/JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger)  
**My PR:** [#5](https://github.com/JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger/pull/5)

I restructured the UI tests to use the Robot Pattern and added a README section to help others adopt it. This change made UI testing more scalable, readable, and maintainable.

The work was widely praised on X ([Post 1](https://x.com/jsedlacekjr/status/1895996434253824487)) and LinkedIn ([Post 1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamessedlacekjr_iosdevelopment-swiftui-opensource-activity-7301761721935826944-a5Q5?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web), [Post 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattheaney23_have-you-ever-used-the-robot-pattern-for-activity-7301353607176568832-C4tQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)), and was featured in the [Mobile Automation Newsletter](https://testableapple.com/newsletter/53/).

## ✅ 3. Basic-Car-Maintenance  
**Project:** [mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance)  
**My PR:** [#385](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance/pull/385)

I fixed broken GitHub Actions on the Basic-Car-Maintenance app. Whilst it turned out to be a super small change, I’ve never worked directly with GitHub Actions before, so it was a fun challenge. I took the chance to dive into a few areas to understand how everything was wired under the hood, including working with .yml files, .sh files and using Fastlane in a new way. 

This was a project I really wanted to help with. The project is used by a range of iOS developers in the community as part of Hacktoberfest, where developers are encouraged to get involved with open source work throughout October. A lot of new developers have used this project to build real life experience, so it was great to help get it ready ahead of Hacktoberfest 2025.
