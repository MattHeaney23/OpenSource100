# OpenSource100

**Progress:** 2 / 100 ✅  

This is a build-in-public challenge where I contribute to 100 open source Swift projects.

Each contribution must involve a new feature, a critical fix, or work in an unfamiliar area. Small changes like typo fixes don’t count.

This challenge is designed to grow my ability to jump into any Swift project and deliver meaningful, immediate value.

## ✅ 1. Deep Dish Swift (Unofficial)  
**Project:** [MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie](https://github.com/MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie)  
**My PR:** [#19](https://github.com/MortenGregersen/DeepDishLie/pull/19)

I added an App Clip to the unofficial Deep Dish Swift app, ahead of giving a talk on App Clips at Deep Dish Swift 2025. This included creating the App Clip target, restructuring the code for modular use, and collaborating with the maintainer to support associated domains, submit to Apple, and release the App Clip.

## ✅ 2. Scrumdinger  
**Project:** [JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger](https://github.com/JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger)  
**My PR:** [#5](https://github.com/JamesSedlacek/Scrumdinger/pull/5)

I restructured the UI tests to use the Robot Pattern and added a README section to help others adopt it. This change made UI testing more scalable, readable, and maintainable.

The work was widely praised on X ([Post 1](https://x.com/jsedlacekjr/status/1895996434253824487)) and LinkedIn ([Post 1](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jamessedlacekjr_iosdevelopment-swiftui-opensource-activity-7301761721935826944-a5Q5?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web), [Post 2](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattheaney23_have-you-ever-used-the-robot-pattern-for-activity-7301353607176568832-C4tQ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)), and was featured in the [Mobile Automation Newsletter](https://testableapple.com/newsletter/53/).
